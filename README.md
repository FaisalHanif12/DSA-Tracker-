# This App is built to keep track of number of Dsa problems solved by you .
This App helps you to optitmise your preparation by  showing a progress bar for total problems solved along with providing progress bar for each and every topic in an interactive form . It contains several other features that help to maintain your consistency and efficiency .

This project is adapted from a curated list of data structure and algorithms (DSA) questions by Raj vikramaditya ( Striver ). The sheet is well known as Striver Sde sheet  , which helps you to build a strong fundamental  in coding and allows you to progress to a strong future  .
